# Project Overview
This project implements a JPEG compression algorithm from scratch, showcasing the key stages of the JPEG standard, including Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantization, and Huffman encoding.
The goal is to understand and visualize how JPEG compression works at a fundamental level.

# Features
Lossy compression following the JPEG standard

Step-by-step visualization of the compression pipeline

Configurable quality settings (adjustable compression ratio)

Comparison tools to evaluate compression performance

Support for common image formats (PNG, BMP, JPG)
